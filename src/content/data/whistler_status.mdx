[Whistler's terrain and lift status](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/the-mountain/mountain-conditions/terrain-and-lift-status.aspx) site lists all the information in difficult to digest tables. [Whistler Lifts](https://www.whistlerlifts.com/) is much more useful, having split the lifts into regions (alpine, mid-mountain, and base for both mountains). However, it would be much easier to see this information on a map.
