## **_BlueCat Networks_**
### **Software Engineer**

_June 2019 - Current_

_Toronto, ON / Remote Canada_

**Description**
- Working in a small research team implementing a variety of prototypes for a DNS based product.
- Free to work in a breadth of areas, and at times called upon for development or time-boxed investigations.
- Built a datalake to replace ElasticSearch Service, greatly reducing cost and increasing analytics capabilities. Data is stored in AWS S3, and queried using Trino.
- Increased product capabilities by writing Flink jobs to analyze DNS data. Improved detection of DGAs (Domain Generated Algorithms) from roughly 25% to 95% with Machine Learning. Adding detection of typosquat queries.
- Prototyped a highly customisable DNS proxy based on a custom DSL that compiles into Rust or WebAssembly. Informed the next version of the DNS proxy, which was rewritten from Java to Rust, and uses a plugin-based architecture.
- Assisted another team with learning Rust and contributing to the open source project Vector. Added support for http and dnstap sources.
- Attended AWS re:Invent 2019 to increase my knowledge of the AWS cloud.

**Languages / Tools:**
Rust, Python, Java, Flink, Vector, Tensorflow/Keras, Trino, AWS (Lambda, Firehose, S3)

### **Software Developer Co-op**

_Jan 2018 - Aug 2018_

_Toronto, ON_

**Description**
