This is part 0 of my notes from the University of Toronto course CSC467: Compilers. This resource should ideally be used to refresh knowledge. I would not recommend using it to learn the material from scratch, since this is a shortened form of my notes I used for review.

This section gives an outline of the notes.

1. [**Lexical Analysis.**](/computers/compilers_part_1) Tokenizing a program.
2. [**Parsing.**](/computers/compilers_part_2) Creating syntax tree, defining grammar.
3. [**Semantic Analysis.**](/computers/compilers_part_3) Extracting meaning from syntax tree.
4. [**Optimization.**](/computers/compilers_part_4) Modify to improve performance.
5. [**Code Generation.**](/computers/compilers_part_5) Produce assembly or byte code.
