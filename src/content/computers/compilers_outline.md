This is the outline of my notes from the University of Toronto course CSC467: Compilers. This resource should ideally be used to refresh knowledge. I would not recommend using it to learn the material from scratch, since this is a shortened form of my notes I used for review.

1. [**Lexical Analysis.**](/computers/compilers/lexical_analysis) Tokenizing a program.
2. [**Parsing.**](/computers/compilers/parsing) Creating syntax tree, defining grammar.
3. [**Semantic Analysis.**](/computers/compilers/semantic_analysis) Extracting meaning from syntax tree.
4. [**Optimization.**](/computers/compilers/optimization) Modify to improve performance.
5. [**Code Generation.**](/computers/compilers/code_generation) Produce assembly or byte code.
