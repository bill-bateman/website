Afro Blue is such a great song - and here is a transcription of the Flute and Marimba solos from the original 1959 recording.

Audio available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbE7jf_Hp5w).

Also, if you haven't heard the Robert Glasper / Erykah Badu version, I definitely recommend checking it out ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_hT61-E5kg)).
