_Adventures of Robot Boy_ is a game I made with my friend for the University of Toronto Game Design and Development Club's annual 2-month Game-Making Deathmatch! The theme for the 2016-2017 competition was something like Other Worlds, so our game idea was to use the planet-hopping mechanic from Super Mario Galaxy.

The gameplay is pretty straightforward platforming, with jumping and collecting coins, and only one enemy. We used freely available assets for the planets and platforms, but my partner created the 3D assets for the player character (Robot Boy) and the enemy (a robot dog). I created (and recorded!) the music. The game itself was in Unity, so C# was the programming language.

In the competition, the game placed 2nd for Best Overall Game, and won Best Sound Design.
