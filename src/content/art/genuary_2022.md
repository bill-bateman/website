I decided to take part in [Genuary 2022](http://genuary.art/) and have some fun creating some generated art. I want to create all of these in code that can run on this website.

1. [Draw 10,000 of something](/art/genuary_2022/1).
2. [Dithering](/art/genuary_2022/2).
3. [Space](/art/genuary_2022/3).
4. [Fidenza](/art/genuary_2022/4).
5. [Destroy a square](/art/genuary_2022/5).
6. [Borrow a style - fidenza cat](/art/genuary_2022/6).
7. [Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing](/art/genuary_2022/7).
8. [Single Curve](/art/genuary_2022/8).
9. [Architecture](/art/genuary_2022/9).
