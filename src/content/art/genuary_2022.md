I decided to take part in [Genuary 2022](http://genuary.art/) and have some fun creating some generated art. I want to create all of these in code that can run on this website.

1. [Draw 10,000 of something](/art/genuary_2022/1) (used HTML5 canvas).
2. [Dithering](/art/genuary_2022/2) (manually editing pixel data).
3. [Space](/art/genuary_2022/3) (used HTML5 canvas).
4. [Fidenza](/art/genuary_2022/4).
