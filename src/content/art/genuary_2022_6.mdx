import Catenza from "../../components/Genuary2022/Catenza.js"

Copying @interphx's [cat-Fidenza](https://twitter.com/interphx/status/1478357511774343177).

<Catenza width="600" height="600" />

If you look closely you can see little gaps in the cats where I draw. This is probably due to how HTML5 canvas draws. So ideally at some point I'll redo this in a different toolkit.

Also the collision detection on the cats isn't quite right.
