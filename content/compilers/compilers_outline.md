This is the outline of my notes from the University of Toronto course CSC467: Compilers. This resource should ideally be used to refresh knowledge. I would not recommend using it to learn the material from scratch, since this is a shortened form of my notes I used for review.

1. [**Lexical Analysis.**](compilers_1_lexical.html) Tokenizing a program.
2. [**Parsing.**](compilers_2_parsing.html) Creating syntax tree, defining grammar.
3. [**Semantic Analysis.**](compilers_3_semantic.html) Extracting meaning from syntax tree.
4. [**Optimization.**](compilers_4_optimization.html) Modify to improve performance.
5. [**Code Generation.**](compilers_5_code_generation.html) Produce assembly or byte code.
