DOG GAME is a game I made for the University of Toronto Game Design and Development Club's annual 2-month Game-Making Deathmatch! The theme for the 2018-2019 competition was Friendship, so my game revolved around a man trying to find his dog (what is man but dog's best friend?).

The gameplay and levels were very simple platforming, with jumping and climbing, and only one enemy. I wanted to focus on creating all the assets myself, including pixel-art, music, and sound effects. 

The pixel-art I created in GIMP by hand. The music was made using some combination of MuseScore and Reaper. The game itself was in Unity, so C# was the programming language.

In the competition, the game placed 2nd for Best Overall Game, and won Best Sound Design.
