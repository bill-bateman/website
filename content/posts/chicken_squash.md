Chicken Squash is just for fun.

You play as two chickens (ideally local multiplayer - 2 players 1 keyboard) and pass an egg back and forth as many times as you can. 

The sprites are hand-drawn. The sound-effects and music are also created by me. The game itself was in Unity, so C# was the programming language.

You can play the game [here](https://batemanzhou.com/games/ChickenSquash/).
